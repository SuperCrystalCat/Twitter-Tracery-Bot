# Twitter Quotes Bot

* ### A Python bot that automatically tweets quotes/lyrics at regular intervals using the Twitter API.
* ### Can be deployed for free on [Replit](https://replit.com) or on your local machine or server.
* ### This is an alternative for those previously using CheapBotsDoneQuick to run their bot.
* ### This is a super simple version that is meant only for pure text tweets such as *posting quotes/lyrics hourly*. There is no support for *images/videos*. If you do need support for Images/Videos, please check out the repo mentioned in the *Credits* section down below.
* ### Recently added Tracery support now allows you to run bots that use a more complex .json file.
